    "Suppose you are working as an Optimization Scientist at a grocery chain throughout New York City. There are 97 stores and 3 distribution centers. Every day, stores place an order for food that must be delivered the next day to ensure they are fully stocked. Given input data about stores' orders, distribution centers, and the available fleet of vehicles, it is your job to calculate the route for each vehicle such that all orders are fulfilled while minimizing vehicles' travel time and cost. For a problem space of 100 locations there are about 100! possible routes. You can do the math yourself- but that's a lot. Lucky for you, you have access to the cuOpt solver. All you need to do is read the input data and preprocess the data. Once all the data is ready, you just need to save it to one Python dictionary and send it to cuOpt, which does all the hard computation for you.\n",
